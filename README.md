# RSD_model3
This code is R/ Shiny/ Stan code for rating Rater Severity Drift (RSD) with a single rater.
This model is Model 3, which was presented at PROMS2024.

Please select and execute the entire command.
A separate window for storing data will appear, so please enter the appropriate data there and run the program.
By default, the number of iterations is set to a high value, so you can change it as you see fit.

Please do not redistribute this code, as it is still under research.

We would be grateful if you could provide any comments on how to improve the model.
